# This is a simple ansible playbook for installing packages needed by the
# libbytesize test suite.
# You can do this by using 'make install-requires' or manually using
# 'ansible-playbook -K -i "localhost," -c local install-test-dependencies.yml'
# Currently only Fedora and Debian/Ubuntu are supported by this playbook.
